## Disclaimers

### Version Variability

**All packages used in this template are tagged with the *`latest`* flag.** This means the versions installed may vary over time. If a package introduces a breaking change that is not yet accommodated in this template, it may affect functionality. Consider specifying more stable version numbers in your `package.json` to mitigate this risk.

### Operating System Compatibility
**Commands in this template are designed for *`Linux`* environments.** Windows users might encounter issues, particularly with commands like `yarn clean` that use `rm -rf`. To adapt:
- Install `rimraf` using your preffered package manager
- Replace `rm -rf` in the `clean` script with `rimraf`.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why choose `yarn` over `pnpm` or `bun`?
**Yarn vs. Pnpm**: On my system, `pnpm` performs slower‚Äîlikely due to my HDD setup versus SSD. Yarn provides a faster experience.
**Yarn vs. Bun**: I prefer to use more established tools in production environments. Bun looks promising, but time will tell whether it is stable or not.

### Why use this template instead of NestJS?
**Template vs. Framework**: Unlike NestJS, which is a comprehensive framework, this project serves as a lightweight template. It allows developers to build scalable APIs without the constraints of a full framework, offering more flexibility.

### How do I run tests?
**Testing**: Test integration is in progress and will be available soon. This will allow for robust validation of your application's functionalities.

### Can I use this template without giving credit?
**Licensing**: This template is released under the MIT license. You are free to use it in any of your projects without attribution.
